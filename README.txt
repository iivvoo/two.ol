Two - it takes two to Django

A Django mini subframework that provides common web/django patterns, 
promotes OO withing Django and attempts to avoid code duplication.

two.ol (prononce 'Tool') is the two code package.

two.ol provides class based views for Django inspired by those offered
by Pyramid, Zope and Zope3. They were initially conceived before Django
introduced its own CBV's.
